# HIV drug resistance in the Rakai Community Cohort Study, 2012 - 2019
This repository contains the data and code needed to replicate the analyses in the manuscript "Population dynamics of HIV drug resistance among pre-treatment and treatment-experienced PLHIV during treatment scale-up in Uganda: a population-based longitudinal study". The raw data is located in the ./data directory and the ./scripts/run_all.sh shell script runs all of the analyses. All code was written by Michael A. Martin, PhD who can be reached at mmart108@jhmi.edu with any questions about the code. Inquiries about the research itself can be directed Dr. M. Kate Grabowski, PhD at mgrabow2@jhmi.edu, who is corresponding author on the manuscript. 

The analysis is all run in the R programming language with the following packages: 

* tidyverse v.2.0.0
* cowplot v.1.1.1
* geepack v.1.3.9
* ggpattern v.1.0.1
* ggplo2 v.3.4.3
* ggrepel v.0.9.3
* haven v.2.5.3
* mtest v.0.9.40
* Readxl v.1.4.3
